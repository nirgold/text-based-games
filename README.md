# text-based-games

This is my first repository on GitHub, where I would add the simple (or not so simple) games I make as I learn how to create them.

# decoder
is a simple decoder app from binary to ascii. It gets a binary code as a string and converts it into the corresponding ascii character.

# decoder_unicode
does the same, but gets a string with a unicode-escaped code. This was really frustrating, becuase python 3 uses unicode as a default,
so it utimately uses one (1) line of code to decode it.

# derive
is a strange little game I used to play in boring classes. Essentially it chooses two words with the same length for you and then asks you to get from the first one to the second one, changing one letter at a time - and each word in between must be valid.

# hangman
is just your standrad random-word guessing game.
